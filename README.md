## Discrete mathematics

### Assignment is as follows
1. A set API In your favorite language, or in a language you want to explore, create an
API for handling sets. Sets can either be finite as {7, 9, 13} or infinite as Z
or {5, . . . }.

Create methods for handling
* Membership
* Intersection
* Union
* Difference
* Complement

Tip create a class for each operation

Also create methods for handling subsets and equality as in exercise.
Bevare, that infinite sets might not be determined whether to be subsets or not, so
we end up with five cases:
* A ⊂ B: -1
* A = B: 0
* A ⊃ B: 1
* Undeterminable: 2
* A * B ∧ B * A: -2  
Tip let 2 be the default value

## Comment
Work is mostly done, was a bit unsure about the subsets, i have something that works, but would proberly need some tuning
Spend alot of time trying to create classes that merged the two sets, until i found out that was not really the assignemnt
