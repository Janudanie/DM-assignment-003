1 A set API
In your favorite language, or in a language you want to explore, create an
API for handling sets. Sets can either be finite as {7, 9, 13} or infinite as Z
or {5, . . . }.
Create methods for handling
• Membership
• Intersection
• Union
• Difference
• Complement
Tip create a class for each operation

Also create methods for handling subsets and equality as in exercise. Bevare,
that infinite sets might not be determined whether to be subsets or not, so
we end up with five cases:
• A ⊂ B: -1
• A = B: 0
• A ⊃ B: 1
• Undeterminable: 2
• A * B ∧ B * A: -2
Tip let 2 be the default value


## Need to fix the README.md (can be more pretty)
